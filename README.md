# Django
A backend project has been developed using Python and Django framework to manage student data, with MongoDB serving as the database. The integration between the Django project and MongoDB is facilitated by the Python library called PyMongo.

In this project, Django provides the web application framework, handling tasks such as routing, views, and business logic. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores the student data in a schema-less format, allowing for flexible data modeling.

PyMongo acts as the bridge between Django and MongoDB, providing a Pythonic interface for interacting with the MongoDB database.
